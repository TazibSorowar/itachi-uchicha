                Itachi Uchiha was a shinobi of Konoha's Uchiha clan
                who served as an Anbu Captain. Who later became an
                international criminal after murdering his entire clan, 
                sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. Afterwards 
                joined the international criminal organization known as 
                Akatsuki.

                <p class="p-2">Itachi Uchiha was ordered by the elders of Conoha to 
                    kill his clan in order to prevent a civil war in the village.
                    Itachi simply followed the orders he was given and
                    caused the extinction of his own clan. He didn't spare his 
                    own parents nor the women he loved. Only his little brother
                    Sasuke was spared.</p>
